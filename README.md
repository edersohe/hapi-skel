## Hapi.js application skeleton

This repo has not intent to be a framework, this is just a proposed structure of an app with Hapi.js.

### Folder structure

* models
* routes
* contollers
* validators
* plugins
* test
* docs

### Integration with Hapi.js plugins

* Swagger plugin
* Good console reporter plugin
* TV plugin
* Lab testing plugin
* Joi Validator plugin

### NPM scripts

* run: `npm start`
* testing: `npm test`
* code coverage: `npm run coverage`
* check deps: `npm run deps`
* check outdated deps: `npm run outdated`
* code linting: `npm run lint`

### Environment Variables and default values

* `PORT=3000`
* `GOOD_CONSOLE=log,response,request,error`
* `SWAGGER_URI=http://localhost:3000`
* `NODE_ENV=development`
* `TV_DEBUG=1` (0 disable plugin)
* `LOG_LEVEL=INFO`

### Other Notes

* `config.js` just initialize variables with env vars if these exist or default values if not exists
* Code linting is done by JSHint and right now just has the basic configuration into `.jshintrc`
* Git exclude javascript IDE's, Node and OSX auto-generated files and are mostly not desirables in your repo, check ``.gitignore` is generated by https://goel.io/joe
* `npm start` load the index.js with PM2 module and is mostly used on production environment if you are on development stage just hit: `node index.js`
